### Directories:
The project directory is organized into the following subdirectories:
- 0_data:
  - contains scripts for processing the data.
  - all input data are publicly available: crop related data (e.g., yields, harvested area, crop progress) from the USDA-NASS quickstats (https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/); crop insurance data from the USDA-RMA Summary of Business (https://www.rma.usda.gov/SummaryOfBusiness/CauseOfLoss); weather data from the PRISM (https://prism.oregonstate.edu/).
  - Due to file size, the final processed data are included here but I will be happy to share the data upon request.
 
- 1_code:
  - contains scripts for analyzing data and creating figures
 
- 2_utils:
  - contains github files
 
- 3_outputs:
  - contains output data
